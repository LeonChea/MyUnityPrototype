Easy Front End Updates


Beta Version 0.11 - 9th March 2016

*** We recommend you delete your old EasyFrontEnd folder before importing this update ***

-Added user events once a transition has completed. (OnTransitionComplete event) Uses the Unity UI system. Can run a function on any of your game objects once the transition has completed.

-Added support for other child object to transition into a panel after the main panel has transitioned in. (Think of a menu screen where the buttons slide in individually after a delay)

-Allowed for a delay on panels which transition in

-Added prefabs for templates as the previous scenes seemed to lose their references when imported to newer versions of unity.
Users should now drag and drop a prefab into their existing scene to get going rather than working from a premade scene.

-Added new template (Vanilla). A portrait template with basic functionality

-Bug Fixes

-Updated documentation.
